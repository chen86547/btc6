Build a trading platform
Cryptocurrency, as a digital asset, usually runs smart contracts through code to complete transactions, and ensures the security of funds through digital signature technology. Brokers must first build a front-end trading platform and access cryptocurrency liquidity to support multi-currency transactions such as BTC and ETH. The trading platform needs to include a matching engine to match buy and sell orders to complete transactions. Secondly, it is necessary to establish a hot and cold wallet and a multi-signature mechanism in the platform. Traders only store a small portion of the funds to be bought and sold in the hot wallet, and digitally sign both parties during the transaction. This can prevent risks such as hacker intrusions and protect the security of digital assets. In addition to this, cryptocurrencies are less liquid. Unlike other investment assets such as stocks, cryptocurrency will suffer from liquidity crunch and sharp price changes when market fluctuations occur. Therefore, the exchange also needs to establish a back-end management system. Including real-time transaction data detection to manage transaction risks.

Generally, brokers will choose to use white label solutions to build cryptocurrency exchanges. By purchasing a complete system, they will include compliance applications, digital exchange source code, token issuance, liquidity access, etc.
